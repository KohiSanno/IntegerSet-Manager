**Project Name: IntegerSet Manager (C#, OOP)**

**Overview:**

IntegerSet Manager is a C# application meticulously designed to manage a collection of integers as a set, employing object-oriented programming to offer a suite of functionalities including element insertion, removal, and queries. This project efficiently represents a set as a sequence of unique elements and includes methods for checking set emptiness, element membership, retrieving a random element, identifying the largest element, and displaying the set's contents.

**Features:**

- Efficient management of a set of integers, ensuring each element is stored uniquely.
- Comprehensive set operations including insertion and removal of elements.
- Functionality to check whether the set is empty and if it contains a specific element.
- Ability to return a random element from the set without modifying the set itself.
- Automated tracking and retrieval of the largest element in the set.
- Implementation of a method to print the current elements of the set, facilitating easy visualization.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Leveraged C#'s robust OOP capabilities to encapsulate set behaviors and properties within a dedicated class.
- Employed generic collections for efficient storage and manipulation of set elements.
- Utilized advanced C# features such as LINQ for operations like finding the largest element and determining set membership.
- Implemented algorithmic optimizations to maintain the largest element in the set efficiently, minimizing computational overhead.
- Designed the class to be extensible and reusable, allowing for future enhancements or integration into larger projects.
